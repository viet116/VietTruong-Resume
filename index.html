        <p class="lead mb-4">Elon Musk is a South African-born entrepreneur, inventor, and visionary who has become one of the most prominent figures in the technology and business worlds. He is the CEO of several cutting-edge companies, including SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, and has been instrumental in driving innovation in industries ranging from space exploration to electric vehicles.

Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa in 1971, and showed an early interest in computers and technology. After completing his secondary education, he moved to Canada to attend Queen's University, but later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a degree in physics and economics.

After graduation, Musk co-founded Zip2, a web software company that provided online business directories and city guides for newspapers. The company was later sold for over $300 million, and Musk used the proceeds to start a new venture, X.com, which eventually became PayPal, the online payment system that revolutionized the way people transfer money online.

In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, with the goal of making space travel more affordable and accessible. Despite initial setbacks and failures, the company has achieved numerous milestones in spaceflight, including becoming the first privately-funded organization to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Musk has also set ambitious goals for the company, including plans to send humans to Mars and establish a colony there in the coming years.

Musk's other major venture is Tesla, the electric car company he founded in 2003. Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was released in 2008, and since then the company has become a leader in the development of electric cars, with models like the Model S and Model X receiving critical acclaim and widespread adoption. Tesla has also made significant strides in the development of autonomous driving technology, with Musk predicting that fully self-driving cars will be on the roads in the near future.

In addition to his work with SpaceX and Tesla, Musk has also founded several other companies, including Neuralink, which is focused on developing brain-machine interface technology, and The Boring Company, which is exploring new methods of tunneling and transportation infrastructure.

Musk's innovative approach to business and technology has earned him numerous awards and accolades, including being named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People and receiving the Heinlein Prize for Advances in Space Commercialization. Despite his many accomplishments, Musk has also faced criticism and controversy, particularly around his leadership style and some of his more outlandish public statements.

Overall, Elon Musk's work has had a profound impact on multiple industries and is likely to continue to shape the future of technology and business for years to come.<br><br>

        Viet is an Elon Musk fan so he used this as a placeholder since he has nothing to input for his resume<br><br>
